Transient:
------------
While we are serializing an object, then if we don't to serialize some data which is present in that serializing object then we should use the word "Transient".
if we use the word the befor a variable name then that particular data will not be serialized
Note:- 1.we can use transient keyword only with the Variables
		we cannot use it for methods
	 2.static variables are not part of object, hence they will also not participate in 	   serialization.
