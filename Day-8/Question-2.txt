if there is a class Animal
and a class Dog that extends Animal

Now if we create Animal a = new Animal();
                 Dog d = (dog) a;


Here we will get ClassCastException,beacause parent class is not pointing to the child class object
So,if we want to downcast the parent class variable ,it should be refering child class.
i.e Animal a = new Dog();
	
    Dog d = (dog) a;

Now we will not get any error
